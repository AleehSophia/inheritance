### :triangular_flag_on_post: Understanding comments
Everytime you see a code commented between 
``` /* text */ ``` means an explanation to some piece of code
or to the subject that I've learned, it's for me to remember.
<br> When you see a code commented in this way, 
`` \\ code `` it's a piece of code that I commented because 
I'm not using it anymore, but I want in there to know how it 
works. <br>
It's important for you to know that this repository have subjects
from a series of classes, this is why I have a lot of code commented.
Only for study and practice purposes.
